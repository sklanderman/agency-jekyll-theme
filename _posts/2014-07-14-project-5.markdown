As an instructor for this course, I designed all lessons based on given curriculum lecturing three days per week; wrote, administered, and graded all exams; and provided tutoring services to undergraduate students enrolled in math classes ranging from college algebra to differential equations.  See an example of my teaching syllabus below.

On the curriculum development side, I also created tools to aid Teaching Assistants for this course.  I designed group work and offered options for student engagement in the classroom by expanding the lecture resources in order to support inexperienced instructors.
