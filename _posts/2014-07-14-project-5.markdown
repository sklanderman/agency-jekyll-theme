description: As an instructor for this course, I designed all lessons based on given curriculum lecturing three days per week; wrote, administered, and graded all exams; and provided tutoring services to undergraduate students enrolled in math classes ranging from college algebra to differential equations.  You can see my teaching syllabi here:

Fall 2014
Spring 2015

On the curriculum development side, I also created tools to aid Teaching Assistants for this course.  I designed group work and offered options for student engagement in the classroom by expanding the lecture resources in order to support inexperienced instructors.
