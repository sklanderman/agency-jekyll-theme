As an instructor for this course, I designed all lessons based on given curriculum and wrote, administered, and graded all exams.  You can see a subset of my teaching syllabi below.

On the curriculum development side, I also created tools to aid Teaching Assistants for this course.  I designed group work and offered options for student engagement in the classroom by expanding the lecture resources in order to support inexperienced instructors.
