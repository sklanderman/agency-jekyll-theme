As an instructor for this course, I designed all lessons based on given curriculum and wrote, administered, and graded all exams.  You can find my teaching syllabus below; all other course materials can be found on the D2L class page.

As a part of a larger MSU initiative to redesign College Algebra, I also developed function-based curriculum to create an adaptive learning-based course, which included writing content, collaborating with administrators and technology staff, and selecting, organizing, and creating assessments.  See an example of that content below.
