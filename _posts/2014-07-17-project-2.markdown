The Transitions to Proof course at MSU is taught in a flipped classroom environment, relying heavily on group work and a secondary teaching assistant.  As an instructor for this course, I designed all lessons based on given curriculum and wrote, administered, and graded all exams.  You can find the teaching syllabi for the classes for which I was in both primary and secondary instructor roles below.
